            <h4>The Creation of This Very Website</h4>

                    The first project in here is of course this website itself. I am a lazy person, so even crafting
                    this little website is considered a significant ordeal for me. I used to be relatively capable with
                    HTML, CSS and JS, but that was almost 2 years ago. So I've had to revisit some videos and re-learn
                    most of this stuff. Oh well. As I'm typing this, the website is not live, nor is it even ready to be
                    considered in anyway a functioning site. This projects page has nothing but a couple of headers, and
                    the home page is filled with just a bunch of useless stuff from me trying to refarmiliarise myself
                    with HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I am typing this second paragraph, the webiste doesn't look too bad, now that I've rekindled my
                    CSS
                    knowledge a little more.

                    In this little ‘blog post’, yes I suppose that’s what you would classify this as, I would like to
                    outline the purpose of this website and the kinds of things you can expect to see on here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon I will be purchasing a 3D printer, and so I intend to post a lot of my prints on this website,
                    partially to show them off, but also to motivate me to make even more of them. I will add another
                    section for this, which by the time you are reading this will already be there. The most important
                    part
                    of the site will be this projects page, where you will be able to read about my various electronics
                    and
                    possibly programming projects here (if I bother to program anything in my free time). As I said
                    before,
                    I’m pretty lazy, but I actually really enjoy making little electronics projects, when I have
                    interesting
                    enough ideas that is. Programming on the other hand is unlikely since I’ve never written a
                    substantial
                    amount of code for anything outside of college. It simply isn’t my passion I suppose, although I do
                    enjoy it, just not enough to push me to do it more often. But who knows, maybe I’ll finish that home
                    assisstant program I was working on many months ago. Now that I’ve discovered the wonderful
                    Raspberry Pi
                    Zero 2 w, I have the perfect system to run the program on, and with that 3D printer coming soon,
                    I’ll
                    even have an enclosure. How exciting.
                </p>

                    My aspirations for the future have me as a cryptographer of some sorts. In about 7 months I’ll be
                    off to
                    study Mathematics at university, and in my eyes there are really only 3 possible paths for me from
                    there. I could spec into applied mathematics, become some sort of physicist or maybe even try to
                    shoe-horn myself into an engineering career. Problem: I don’t like physics. Or maybe I do, a little,
                    but
                    with how poor my teachers have been over the years (especially right now, my goodness), any
                    enjoyment of
                    the subject has left me. Besides, I don’t think I’ve ever gone out of my way to look into physics in
                    my
                    own time the way I do with maths and computer science, but I digress. Another option is statistics,
                    which could lead to a nice, well paid career in data science. Problem: I’m not a fan of statistics.
                    Statistics in my opinion, isn’t too difficult, but what it is, is mind numbingly boring. Final
                    option,
                    Pure Mathematics (the best part) with a heavy focus on number theory in order to steer me into
                    cryptography. That’s the (very loose) plan right now I suppose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway the reason I went on that huge tangent is to mention that I need to look into stuff related
                    to
                    cryptography and cyber security in general. This pertains to the topic of this here website in two
                    ways:
                    I may post about such topics, and I need to get a more private email service so I can setup a
                    functioning contact page, as well as making my technological presence more secure too, without
                    having to
                    become a complete social outcast in the process (probably impossible, considering how many services
                    out
                    there either sell your data or are just outright spyware). Back to the email, I doubt anyone will
                    bother
                    to contact me, but no website is complete without a nice contact section.
                </p>

                    If you look at the top of this page you will see ‘Posted on 12/02/22’, but it is infact now
                    13/02/22,
                    and as such, in the interest of healthy sleeping habits, I will be ending this first post soon, but
                    before I do, I need to mention the final purpose of this website, the about me page: a lovely excuse
                    to
                    write things, which I may or may not do. Fancy.
                </p>

                    Thank you for reading, here’s to many more mediocre posts!
